### 1. **High Transition Probabilities**:
   - The transition probabilities between states (e.g., `high_repair` and `low_repair`) may be high across the dataset. If the probabilities of all observed transitions exceed the set **threshold** (currently `0.1`), no transitions will be flagged as anomalous.

### 2. **Threshold Value**:
   - The current threshold for detecting anomalies is **0.1**. This means that a transition will only be considered anomalous if its probability is below 10%. If the transition probabilities between states are higher than this, no anomalies will be detected.
   - It might be helpful to lower this threshold to capture more transitions as anomalies.

### 3. **State Labeling**:
   - The way states (`high_repair`, `low_repair`) are created could be causing transitions to appear uniform. For example, if most products have a similar `RepairFrequency`, the states may not vary much, leading to fewer or no low-probability transitions.

### **Steps to Improve**:

1. **Check Transition Probabilities**:
   - Print the **transition matrix** to see if any of the transition probabilities are low (below the current threshold of `0.1`). This will help confirm if the probabilities are too high for the threshold youâ€™ve set.
   
   Add the following line after `calculate_transition_matrix(state_labels)` in the script:
   ```python
   print("Transition Matrix:", dict(transition_matrix))
   ```

2. **Lower the Threshold**:
   - Try lowering the threshold to capture more anomalies. For instance, reduce it from `0.1` to something smaller (e.g., `0.05` or `0.01`).
   
   Update the line in the `detect_anomalies` function:
   ```python
   anomalies = detect_anomalies(state_labels, transition_matrix, threshold=0.05)
   ```

3. **Adjust State Labeling**:
   - Review how the states (`high_repair` vs. `low_repair`) are defined. Instead of just using the median, you might want to try different criteria or more granular states to introduce more variety in the transitions.

4. **Check the Number of Transitions**:
   - Ensure there are enough transitions in the dataset to detect anomalies. If there are only a few state changes in the data, there might not be enough transitions for the model to detect anomalies.

### **Next Steps**:
1. **Print the Transition Matrix**: Check the actual probabilities in the transition matrix to see if the transitions are uniform.
2. **Lower the Threshold**: Reduce the threshold to capture more anomalies.
3. **Try Different State Definitions**: You can try a more refined way of defining states.

Would you like to try any of these steps, or should I help implement them in the code?
