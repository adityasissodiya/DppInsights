### 1. **High Transition Probabilities**:
   - The transition probabilities between states (e.g., `high_repair` and `low_repair`) may be high across the dataset. If the probabilities of all observed transitions exceed the set **threshold** (currently `0.1`), no transitions will be flagged as anomalous.

### 2. **Threshold Value**:
   - The current threshold for detecting anomalies is **0.1**. This means that a transition will only be considered anomalous if its probability is below 10%. If the transition probabilities between states are higher than this, no anomalies will be detected.
   - It might be helpful to lower this threshold to capture more transitions as anomalies.

### 3. **State Labeling**:
   - The way states (`high_repair`, `low_repair`) are created could be causing transitions to appear uniform. For example, if most products have a similar `RepairFrequency`, the states may not vary much, leading to fewer or no low-probability transitions.
