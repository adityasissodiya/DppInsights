### 1. **Inertia (within-cluster sum of squares)**:
- **Inertia** is a measure of how well the data points are clustered around the centroids of the clusters.
- It is calculated as the **sum of squared distances** between each data point and the nearest cluster center.
  
  \[
  \text{Inertia} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \min_{k} \left( \text{distance between } x_i \text{ and cluster center } C_k \right)^2 \right)
  \]
  
- **Lower inertia** means that the data points are closer to their respective cluster centers, indicating tighter clusters. However, a very low inertia could also indicate overfitting, where the model creates too many small clusters.
  
- **Inertia Value**: `6271.99`
  - This number, in itself, doesn't have much meaning without context or comparison. Compare this value across different numbers of clusters (`n_clusters`). Typically, a **"elbow method"** is used, where you plot inertia for different values of `k` (number of clusters) and look for a point where the decrease in inertia slows down (forming an elbow shape). This can help in determining the optimal number of clusters.

### 2. **Silhouette Score**:
- The **silhouette score** measures how similar a data point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. It ranges from **-1 to 1**, with the following interpretations:
  - **+1**: The data point is well inside its cluster and far from neighboring clusters (good clustering).
  - **0**: The data point is on or very near the boundary between clusters.
  - **-1**: The data point is closer to a neighboring cluster than its own cluster (bad clustering).
  
  \[
  \text{Silhouette Score} = \frac{b - a}{\max(a, b)}
  \]
  Where:
  - `a` is the mean distance between the data point and other points in the same cluster.
  - `b` is the mean distance between the data point and points in the nearest neighboring cluster.

- **Silhouette Score**: `0.11`
  - A silhouette score of **0.11** is quite low, suggesting that the clustering is not very well-defined. This means that many points are either too close to the boundary between clusters or are in the wrong cluster.
  
#### What Does This Indicate?
- **Inertia** alone isnâ€™t sufficient to judge the clustering, as it generally decreases with an increasing number of clusters. However, in combination with the **silhouette score**, we get a clearer picture.
- **Low Silhouette Score (0.11)**: This suggests that the clusters formed by K-Means are not very well-separated or distinct. In practice, a good silhouette score is usually above **0.5**. A low score like 0.11 indicates that many data points are close to the decision boundaries between clusters, and the clustering structure may not be well-suited to the data.

### Possible Reasons for Low Silhouette Score:
1. **Number of Clusters (`n_clusters`)**: 
   - The number of clusters may not be optimal. Try experimenting with different values of `n_clusters` (e.g., 2, 4, 5) to see if the silhouette score improves.
   
2. **Data Characteristics**: 
   - If the data doesn't have well-separated natural groupings, it may be difficult for K-Means to form distinct clusters. This can happen if the data features are not strongly correlated with the underlying cluster structure.
   
3. **Feature Engineering**: 
   - There might be room to improve feature engineering, such as using domain knowledge to create more relevant features or applying dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA) before clustering.
