Let's break down the output from the **Deep Learning Regression** model:

### 1. **TensorFlow and Hardware Warnings**
You see several TensorFlow-related warnings at the beginning:
- **GPU not used**: Since TensorFlow couldn't find CUDA drivers on your machine, the model is running on the CPU. This doesn't impact correctness but may slow down training compared to a GPU.
- **oneDNN custom operations**: This message indicates that TensorFlow is using custom CPU optimizations, and minor numerical differences may occur due to the computation order.
- **cuFFT, cuDNN, cuBLAS registration errors**: These are related to missing GPU libraries (CUDA, cuDNN). They don't affect CPU execution.

These warnings can be ignored for your current setup, as the model will still work fine on the CPU.

### 2. **Training Process (Epochs 1-20)**
The model trained for **20 epochs**. During each epoch, the **loss** (mean squared error) decreases, which indicates that the model is learning and improving its predictions over time. Here's what happened:

- **Loss** (mean squared error) starts at **340,759** and gradually decreases across the epochs.
- By the end of training (Epoch 20), the **loss** has reduced to **81,275**, meaning that the model has managed to reduce the prediction error significantly over the training process.

This downward trend in loss suggests that the model is improving, though it might not have fully converged yet. You could try training for more epochs to see if the error continues to decrease.

### 3. **Model Evaluation on Test Data**
After training, the model was evaluated on the **test set**. Here’s a breakdown of the evaluation metrics:

#### **Mean Squared Error (MSE): 99,310.41**
- **MSE** measures the average of the squared differences between the actual values and predicted values.
  
  \[
  \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( y_i - \hat{y}_i \right)^2
  \]

  - **Interpretation**: An **MSE of 99,310.41** means that, on average, the squared difference between the true `RepairCost` and the predicted `RepairCost` is high. The error is still significant, even though it improved over the course of training. The model is making large errors on the test data.
  
  - The high MSE suggests that while the model improved during training, it’s not making very accurate predictions on the test data.

#### **Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 267.69**
- **MAE** measures the average absolute differences between actual values and predicted values.
  
  \[
  \text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left| y_i - \hat{y}_i \right|
  \]

  - **Interpretation**: An **MAE of 267.69** means that, on average, the model’s predictions are off by **267 units** of `RepairCost`. This gives a clearer interpretation than MSE, showing that the model is making substantial errors on its predictions (for example, if `RepairCost` is in dollars, the average prediction error would be $267).

#### **R-squared (R2): -0.22**
- **R2** measures how well the model explains the variance in the target variable. An \( R^2 \) value of **1** means perfect prediction, **0** means the model is as good as predicting the mean, and **negative values** indicate that the model is performing **worse than predicting the mean**.

  \[
  R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum \left( y_i - \hat{y}_i \right)^2}{\sum \left( y_i - \bar{y} \right)^2}
  \]

  - **Interpretation**: An \( R^2 \) of **-0.22** means the model is performing **worse than predicting the mean** for `RepairCost`. In other words, if you predicted the mean value of `RepairCost` for every test instance, you'd get a better result than this model’s predictions. This indicates the model is **underfitting** and not learning meaningful patterns in the data.

---

### **What This All Means**:
1. **Model Underfitting**: The **negative R-squared (-0.22)** indicates that the model is underfitting. This means that the neural network is not capturing the relationships between the input features and the target (`RepairCost`). It might be too simple for the complexity of the data or not trained long enough.
   
2. **Prediction Errors Are Large**: The **MSE** and **MAE** show that the model is making substantial errors when predicting `RepairCost`. These large errors suggest that the neural network is not adequately modeling the target variable, potentially due to:
   - Insufficient training (more epochs needed).
   - Inappropriate feature selection (input features might not be good predictors of `RepairCost`).
   - The neural network architecture might be too simple (more complex models could help).

3. **Room for Improvement**: 
   - **More epochs**: The model may benefit from training for more than 20 epochs, as the loss was still decreasing by the final epoch.
   - **Tuning architecture**: You could experiment with adding more layers, neurons, or regularization techniques like dropout to prevent overfitting.
   - **Feature engineering**: Try creating additional features that might be more predictive of `RepairCost`, or use techniques like PCA to reduce dimensionality.

### **Next Steps**:
- **Try more epochs**: You can increase the number of epochs to see if the loss continues to decrease and the test performance improves.
- **Adjust the model architecture**: Consider making the neural network deeper or adding regularization.
- **Feature engineering**: Investigate if there are additional or alternative features that could improve prediction accuracy.

Would you like to try some improvements, or should we move on to the **Anomaly Detection** section of the project?
