### 1. **Mean Squared Error (MSE): 83922.43**

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** is a metric that measures the average squared difference between the actual values (e.g., true `RepairCost`) and the predicted values (e.g., predicted `RepairCost`). It's calculated as:
  
  \[
  \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( y_i - \hat{y}_i \right)^2
  \]

  Where:
  - \( y_i \) is the actual value (true `RepairCost`).
  - \( \hat{y}_i \) is the predicted value (predicted `RepairCost`).
  - \( n \) is the number of data points.

  - **Interpretation**: The MSE of **83922.43** indicates that, on average, the squared difference between the true `RepairCost` values and the predicted `RepairCost` values is quite large. Since MSE penalizes larger errors more severely (because the error is squared), a higher MSE means that the model is making significant errors in its predictions.

### 2. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 249.08**

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** is another measure of prediction error, but instead of squaring the errors, it takes the average of the absolute differences between actual and predicted values. It's calculated as:
  
  \[
  \text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left| y_i - \hat{y}_i \right|
  \]

  - **Interpretation**: The MAE of **249.08** means that, on average, the model's predictions for `RepairCost` are off by about **249 units** (whatever unit `RepairCost` is measured in, likely currency like dollars or euros). MAE is easier to interpret than MSE because it's in the same unit as the target variable.

  - **Key difference from MSE**: MAE gives a more direct interpretation of how far off the predictions are, while MSE is more sensitive to larger errors due to the squaring of the differences.

### 3. **R-squared (R2): -0.03**

- **R-squared (R2)**, also known as the **coefficient of determination**, measures how well the model explains the variance in the target variable (e.g., `RepairCost`). It's calculated as:

  \[
  R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum \left( y_i - \hat{y}_i \right)^2}{\sum \left( y_i - \bar{y} \right)^2}
  \]

  Where:
  - \( \hat{y}_i \) are the predicted values.
  - \( y_i \) are the actual values.
  - \( \bar{y} \) is the mean of the actual values.
  
  - **Interpretation**:
    - **R2 = -0.03** means that the model is performing **worse than a simple mean-based prediction**. 
    - In other words, to simply predict the **mean of `RepairCost` for every instance**, it likely performs better than the current Random Forest model. 
    - A perfect model would have **R2 = 1**, meaning it explains all the variance in the data, while **R2 = 0** means the model explains none of the variance (as bad as guessing the mean). An **R2 < 0** suggests that the modelâ€™s predictions are worse than using the average value as the prediction.

### **What Does This Mean?**

1. **Poor Model Performance**: 
   - The model's predictions are off by large amounts, as shown by the high **MSE** and **MAE** values.
   - The **negative R2 score (-0.03)** indicates that the model is not explaining the variance in the data and is performing worse than a simple baseline (e.g., guessing the average `RepairCost` for every product).
   
2. **Potential Causes**:
   - **Insufficient or irrelevant features**: The features being used to predict `RepairCost` may not be strongly correlated with it. This suggests that the features like `YearOfManufacture`, `MaterialPlastic`, etc., may not be the best predictors of `RepairCost`.
   - **Model Configuration**: The model itself may require fine-tuning, though Random Forests are generally robust. Try adjusting parameters like `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, etc., but the primary issue might be the features.
   - **Need for additional data**: Might need to create new features (feature engineering) or gather more relevant data to improve the prediction.

3. **Actionable Steps**:
   - **Feature Engineering**: Try creating more meaningful features or selecting features that are more directly related to `RepairCost`. For instance, including data about the **usage history** of products or specific **repair events** might provide more predictive power.
   - **Try Other Models**: Random Forests might not be capturing the complexity of the relationship between features and `RepairCost`. Try using more complex models like **deep learning regression** (which we'll tackle next) or simpler linear regression models to see how they perform.
